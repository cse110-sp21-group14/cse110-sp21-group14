- Yinxuan (Nora) Du [:joy:](https://didyxdi.github.io/cse110wk1/)

    > I am Yinxuan Du and I go for Nora. I am currently a second year CS student from Warren college! I am passionate about competitive programming, CS education and entrepreneurship. I don’t have a very clear plan for the future yet, but I am very interested in trying a variety of options. Looking forward to working with everyone else!

  
- Joshua Zhu [:stuck_out_tongue:](https://jqzhuuuu.github.io/Pages/)

    > I’m Joshua Zhu, a second year CS major from Sixth! I enjoy baking, competitive video games, and am willing to pick up anything if it’s fun! As for the future, I have no idea what I want to do - but hopefully with the different things I’m learning, I will find that special thing for me.

- Yezhang Liu [:joy:](https://github.com/YezhangLiu/MyWebPage)

    > I’m Yezhang Liu. I’m a ECE 3rd year student from Revelle. I enjoy coding just the same as playing video games. I also play the violin when I’m free, though I haven’t played for a long time. Leisure time for me is precious recently. I hope I can enrich my resume after this quarter and find a good internship.


- Yaofeng(Hugo) Huang [:grimacing:](https://yaofeng-hugo-huang.github.io/CSE110_SP21/)

    > Hi, this is Hugo. I’m a 3rd year student majoring in CS from Muir. I’m born and raised in China. I’m excited to have the opportunity to work with everyone here. I did experience some levels of social death in the past while working on the school stuff alone. Yeah, after this class, I hope everyone can have one more great project on our resume for us to hunt for an internship.


- Kevin Lam [:wink:](https://ckckcake.github.io/GitHub-Pages/)

    > Hi, I’m Kevin. I’m a sophomore in Marshall majoring in computer science. Some of my hobbies when I’m not busy with school are playing tennis, reading light novels, and playing games,  mainly Maplestory at the moment. This is my first time working in a team environment with programming, so I’m excited to learn and collaborate with my group this quarter!

I'm currently a second year CS major in Muir college, and a few of my hobbies include playing video games, messing around with my guitar, watching Netflix, or honestly just anything that catches my attention (just figured out how to pick a lock with hairpins so catch me spending my next paycheck on a lockpicking set). Looking forward to diving into software engineering!
