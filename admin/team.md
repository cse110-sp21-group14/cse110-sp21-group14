    > I’m Joshua Zhu, a second year CS major from Sixth! I enjoy baking, competitive video games, and am willing to pick up anything if it’s fun! As for the future, I have no idea what I want to do - but hopefully with the different things I’m learning, I will find that special thing for me.


### Members:
- Yezhang Liu [:joy:](https://github.com/YezhangLiu/MyWebPage)

    > I’m Yezhang Liu. I’m a ECE 3rd year student from Revelle. I enjoy coding just the same as playing video games. I also play the violin when I’m free, though I haven’t played for a long time. Leisure time for me is precious recently. I hope I can enrich my resume after this quarter and find a good internship.


- Yaofeng(Hugo) Huang *TODO*

    > Hi, this is Hugo. I’m a 3rd year student majoring in CS from Muir. I’m born and raised in China. I’m excited to have the opportunity to work with everyone here. I did experience some levels of social death in the past while working on the school stuff alone. Yeah, after this class, I hope everyone can have one more great project on our resume for us to hunt for an internship.

Looking forward to diving into software engineering!
