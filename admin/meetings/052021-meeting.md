### Notes:
qualify bullets; one particular bullet can show up on the calendar
- set maximum 5 bullets to show in calendar for each day

blue sidebar (not needed in calendar)

### Notes from Sanat:
- Dissolve CI/CD + Testing, have them merge and spread out into other role
- end of week 9 is the last day to do any form of development
  - anything past should be focused on testing

Functionalities (core features) - must all be our own implementation
- Logging (write js to fetch and store from backend)
- Bullets and nestable bullets (do we even have a text editor)
  - nested bullets!!!!
- index / navigation (sidebar + calendar)
- collections (grouping data in ways, like tags + categories)
  - adding a label
  - journals + pages
  - we have this with stephen’s demo
- Monthly view (future log) is satisfied with calendar view

We have some additional features - security (with encryption), login
Get on below topics after MVP is completed
- design + personalization (settings, with colors/font)
- accessibility (dark mode, high contrast mode, font size changing, keyboard shortcuts)
- goodnotes (like default templates, backgrounds, etc.)
- export / migration (capability to take log as pdf)
- camera/handwriting/etc. (prolly not)
