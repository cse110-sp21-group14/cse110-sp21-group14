# June 1, 2021 Meeting (7:00 - 8:00 PM)
Attendance: Nathaniel, Joshua, Kevin, Jun, Nora, Michael, Hugo, Aidan, Tony

Notes:
- Testing:
  - test those that don’t interact with the DOM, etc. for any functionality using Jest
    - anything with simple js keep it in jest (returning values, etc.)	
  - for UI, work with puppeteer
- In addition to styling, need to add fonts
  - customization part of settings tab

Deployment:
- If we have a lot of Nord objects, use heroku
  - check out free tokens, etc.
- github pages
- If we want to extend deployment, then we can look at digital ocean, etc.

Explore for settings:
- font type vs font size
- for dark modes:
  - explore gradients
- we can explore just having toggles for above;
