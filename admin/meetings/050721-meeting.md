### May 7, 2021 Meeting (2:45 - 3:15 PM) with Sanat
start with google sign in - problems can come up when layering google sign in and username/password signin
get google sign in to be implemented first
- data encryption for each person/signin
- store encrypted data instead of raw data

- mongo for backend, html/css/javascript for frontend, using express for pages

### For frontend:
- start coding for html for wireframes ASAP
  - get easy stuff out of the way; 
- by the end of this week, get login / main menu page mapped out
  - for html; css would be nice
  - move on to views after

### For backend:
- research mongo, look at what and how you can use it
- map out schemas for collections you want to store
  - EX. storing collections for user
  - put collections onto mongo
  - so that way can set up json for those

### Need to use pull requests / issues
- CI/CD team needs to get on this ASAP
- canâ€™t just pull / commit like whatever

### repo team
1. first decide on some conventions for repository
   - branching
   - how to name branches
   - how to structure code around repo
2. pull request strategy
   - checks what code is going in, sets up something like a manual review
     - repo members approve before commits go through and get pushed into main branch
3. work on CI/CD pipeline
   - work out conventions for core 
     - style format
     - comment format

### standups should be mainly for this class from now on!
- other class work falls under (stuff that blocking your progress)
