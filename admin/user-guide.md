### 2. **My Journal**

2.1 Concepts of journals and pages

Users can add bullet entries under **My Journal** page, and there are two main options: journals and pages.

Journal is a broad management approach. It doesn't need details about the content, but clear structure to navigate files efficiently.

Page then can be added under the journal it belongs to. It includes more information about the journal entry users want to keep track of.
