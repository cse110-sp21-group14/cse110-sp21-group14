### 2. **My Journal**

2.1 Concepts of Journals and Pages

You can add bullet entries under the **My Journal** page. To store your entries journals will hold pages, and those pages will store your bullets.

Journals don't need details about the content, but it has clear structure to navigate pages efficiently.

Pages can then be added under the journal it belongs to. It includes more information about the journal users want to keep track of - a title, a date, and the actual content.
