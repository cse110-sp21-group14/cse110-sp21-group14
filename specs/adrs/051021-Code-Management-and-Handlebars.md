## Context and Problem Statement

Need to build a skeleton of the bullet journal project to manage code efficiently such that the integrations between frontend and backend would become more smooth. <br>
How to make frontend and backend people work simultaneously while maintaining code security?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Easy to learn
* Easy for both frontend and backend to achieve and maintain (ex. we should not make considerable changes when each new feature is added.)
* Easy to navigate to files that cause troubles
<!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* Work separately and merge codes at the end
* Build a skeleton in full stack view and add features from both frontend and backend during developement period.
<!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Build a Skeleton using Handlebars", because 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* The frontend and backend can work independently while adding their code to the skeleton without causing problems to the whole project.
* Repo builders and testers can also work concurrently with other members to keep track of newly added features and test that the current project works without bugs, rather than working on each end after all the work is done.
